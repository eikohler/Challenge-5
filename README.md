# Work Day Scheduler
Created a work day schedule web app that uses jQuery, Bootstrap, jQuery UI and font awesome
icons third party API.
Displays 9-5 working hours in the day and color codes based on time of the day, i.e, past,
present or future. Displays the current date at the top of the page.
When then user enters a note in a specific time block and clicks the subsequent save icon
the note is saved for that timeblock and remains in local storage to be pulled from and
filled back in if the page is refreshed.
